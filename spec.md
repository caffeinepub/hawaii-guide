# Hawaii Guide / Visit Oahu

## Current State
The app has three pages:
- `/` — HawaiiGuide (main Hawaii guide)
- `/dining` — DiningHawaii (dining blog with search/filter)
- `/visit-oahu` — VisitOahu2 (Visit Oahu standalone page with attractions, activities, dining, and tips)

The VisitOahu2 page is fully built with branding "Visit Oahu", a hero section using the uploaded coastline photo, attraction cards, activity cards, dining highlights, visitor tips, and a footer.
