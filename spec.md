# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a Dining Hawaii blog section to the existing Hawaii Guide, showcasing local restaurants and Hawaiian culinary culture in a style consistent with the rest of the guide.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a "Dining" nav link in the main navigation that smooth-scrolls to the new section
- Create a Dining Hawaii blog section with at least 6 static dining cards, each displaying a title, short description, cuisine/food type tag, island location, and an image
- Cover topics including poke bowls, shave ice, plate lunch, luau feasts, fine dining, and local markets
- Style the section using the existing tropical color palette (ocean, golden, coral, sand) and card layouts matching DestinationCard/ActivityCard components
- Load dining card images from the generated assets folder

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate to a new Dining Hawaii section from the main page and browse blog-style cards highlighting diverse Hawaiian food experiences across the islands.
